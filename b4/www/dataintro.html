    <title>Dataset Information</title>
    <h4><strong>Dataset Introduction</strong></h4>
    <p>
      This is a countrywide car accident dataset that initially covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data were collected from February 2016 to March 2023, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by various entities, including the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road networks. The dataset currently contains approximately 7.7 million accident records.

    <h4><strong>Dataset Processing</strong></h4>
    <p>
      Since the original dataset is too large (7,728,394 rows and the size is around 5GB), I did the following work to simplify it for my app:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I deleted all the rows that contain missing values.</li>
      <li>I filtered variables that won't be helpful to my project (only keeping 10 variables).</li>
      <li>I only picked the first row out of every twenty, which helped me reduce the size of the dataset considerably (only 375,516 rows left and the size is around 30 MB).</li>
      <li>Finally, I used `sample_n()` to select 30,000 rows randomly for my shinyapp.
    </ul>
    
    <h4><strong>Variable Introduction</strong></h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Severity:</strong> Shows the severity of the accident, a number between 1 and 4, where 1 indicates the least impact on traffic (i.e., short delay as a result of the accident) and 4 indicates a significant impact on traffic (i.e., long delay).</li>
      <li><strong>Start_Time:</strong> Shows start time of the accident in local time zone.</li>
      <li><strong>Start_Lat:</strong> Shows latitude in GPS coordinate of the start point.</li>
      <li><strong>Start_Lng:</strong> Shows longitude in GPS coordinate of the start point.</li>
      <li><strong>State:</strong> Shows the state in address field.</li>
      <li><strong>Sunrise_Sunset:</strong> Shows the period of day (i.e. day or night) based on sunrise/sunset.</li>
      <li><strong>Temperature.F.:</strong> Shows the temperature (in Fahrenheit).</li>
      <li><strong>Humidity...:</strong> Shows the humidity (in percentage).</li>
      <li><strong>Pressure.in.:</strong> Shows the air pressure (in inches).</li>
      <li><strong>Visibility.mi.:</strong> Shows visibility (in miles).</li>
      <li><strong>Weather_Condition:</strong> Shows the weather condition (rain, snow, thunderstorm, fog, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
